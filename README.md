Calculator created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

CURRENT BUGS: 
  - No negative sign functionality
  - If "=" pressed after operation, then display resets. Instead, it 
  should wait for a y value
  - Round answers using scientific notation if they are a certain
  size
  - Round off error in calculations including mixed numbers, i.e 
  "3.0 - 3.3 = -0.299..98" instead of " = -0.3"
